# Steps performed:
- Download the file from online and unzip
- Read all files into R
- Merge all files into one dataframe
- Transform dataframe into tibble
- Relabel tibble columns
- Extract mean & SD data
- Add descriptive activity labels
- Add descriptive variable labels
- Create tidy data with means of each variable for each activity and subject
- Save tidy data
